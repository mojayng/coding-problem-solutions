GIT PUSH Error:
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/mojayng/coding-problem-solutions'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

fix:
git pull --rebase
git push
